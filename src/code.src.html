  A selection of the more useful ones:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/leanderthiele/hmpdf'>hmpdf</a>:
      Computes PDFs of tSZ and lensing fields within the halo model.
      An extension allows halo-model calculations of (r)tSZ spectral distortion monopoles.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/leanderthiele/voxelize'>voxelize</a>:
      Maps particle catalogs from cosmological simulations to regular grids.
      Optional GPU acceleration.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/leanderthiele/group_particles'>group_particles</a>:
      A solution to the common problem of finding all simulation particles in the vicinity
      of halos and computing summary statistics on them.
      The code are header-only C++ templates, allowing for great flexibility with no runtime
      penalty.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href='https://github.com/leanderthiele/capped_mean'>capped_mean</a>:
      Small pytorch extension for efficient batch-wise averages where individual batch elements
      have varying data size.
      This is a common operation in set-based architectures.
      A CUDA version allows seamless GPU utilization.
    </li>
  </ul>
