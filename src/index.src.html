  I work in theoretical and data-driven cosmology.
  Currently, my interests revolve around the non-linear aspects of
  the late-time universe, including cosmic voids, higher-order statistics
  for weak lensing, and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
  I am also interested in the galaxy-halo connection and field-level methods.

  Methods-wise, I have experience running and working with numerical simulations,
  including full-physics, N-body, and approximate surrogates.
  Much of my work involves machine learning, in particular baryon pasting (for tSZ),
  and implicit likelihood-inference.
  I strive to elevate applications of machine learning in cosmology from unwieldy
  black boxes to interpretable models with limited, well-defined scope.

  Since March 2024, I work as an assistant professor in the
  <a href="https://cd3.ipmu.jp/">Center for Data-Driven Discovery</a> at Kavli-IPMU/U-Tokyo.
  I received a PhD in Physics from Princeton University where David Spergel advised me.
  Previously, I received a BA from Oxford University and obtained an MSc through the PSI program
  at Perimeter Institute.
