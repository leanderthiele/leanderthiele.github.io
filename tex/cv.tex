		\item thesis: \emph{Capturing non-Gaussianity: Analytic model for the one-point
		probability distribution function of cosmological fields within the halo model}
%		\begin{quote}\footnotesize
%		A powerful observable for cosmological fields primarily sourced by
%		massive halos is their one-point probability distribution function.
%		We present a general model for the one-point PDF, taking into account
%		previously neglected corrections. Application of the model
%		to the thermal Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich PDF is successfully confirmed by
%		comparison to simulations. Preliminary results concerning the weak
%		lensing convergence seem to indicate that our model is in fact more
%		precise than the simulations.
